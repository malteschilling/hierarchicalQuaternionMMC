# hierarchicalQuaternionMMC
Implementation of a hierarchical Mean of Multiple Computation neural network in Python. The body model is based on an axis-angle representation of joint movements using dual quaternions. It is shown in detail how the network provides a solution for the forward kinematic problem applied for the case of a seven degrees of freedom robot manipulator. Furthermore, it is used in a complex scenario of a bimanual movement task. This demonstrates how the MMC approach can be easily scaled up from a representation of a single arm to a complex model of a complete body.
